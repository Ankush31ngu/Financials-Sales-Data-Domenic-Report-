INSIGHT'S💡:-

📈 Sales Trends: The sales peaked at $12M in September 2014, indicating a potential seasonal trend. The trend also shows a dip in the middle of the year (May-July), so targeted promotions or campaigns could help smoothen this dip.

📑 Country-wise Sales Distribution: The sales are almost evenly distributed between the United States, Canada, France, and Germany, indicating a well-balanced international market presence. However, Mexico shows room for improvement.

📊 Product Performance: There’s a large discrepancy between the top-performing product "Paseo" ($33M) and the lowest performer "Carretera" ($14M). This suggests focusing more on product development or marketing for low performers.

🧠 Sales by Segment: With the government sector leading at 44%, there’s a reliance on a single sector. Expanding sales in underrepresented segments like "Enterprise" (2%) and "Small Business" (36%) could mitigate risks.

💰 Discount Band: The majority of sales are from "Medium" (33%) and "High" (31%) discount bands. This indicates that discounts are a significant driver for sales, but further analysis is required to check how this affects overall profitability.

These objectives and insights can help prioritize areas for growth, cost savings, and market penetration.
